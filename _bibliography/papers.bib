  abstract = {This paper presents the formulation, design procedure, and application of a hybrid model predictive control (HMPC) scheme for hybrid systems that is embedded in a mixed logical dynamical (MLD) framework. The proposed scheme adopts a three degrees-of-freedom (3DoF) tuning method to accomplish precise setpoint tracking and ensure robustness in the face of disturbances (both measured and unmeasured) and uncertainty. Furthermore, the HMPC algorithm employs setpoint and disturbance anticipation to proactively enhance controller performance and potentially reduce control effort. Slack variables in the objective function prevent the mixed-integer quadratic problem from becoming infeasible. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through its application in three distinct case studies, which include control of production–inventory systems, time-varying behavioral interventions for physical activity, and management of epidemics/pandemic prevention. These case studies indicate that the HMPC algorithm can effectively manage hybrid dynamics, setpoint tracking and disturbance rejection in diverse and demanding circumstances, while tuned to perform well in the presence of nonlinearity and uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Plants with integrators possess control-relevant modeling requirements that are typically ignored in the literature. Desired closed-loop speeds of response for such systems can differ significantly from their open-loop dynamics, causing conventional system identification guidelines to fail or be inaccurate. One such issue relates to experimental design. This paper presents guidelines for the design of excitation signals for system identification of plants with integrators, with application to the modeling and control of a microalgae raceway reactor. The concept is to excite the system through optimized test signals with control-relevant shaping of their power spectra. This facilitates a shift in emphasis of the identification objective from estimating a model with good open-loop performance to having a model possessing desired closed-loop characteristics. Such a consideration is particularly important when generating informative databases for estimating predictive models for closed-loop control. An illustration for this experimental design procedure is accomplished in this paper through the estimation of ARX-based models and, subsequently, model predictive control of the pH dynamics of an experimental raceway photobioreactor facility hosting sustainable microalgae production.}

  abstract = {Objective
              Digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs) are feasibly effective tools for addressing physical activity. However, in-depth understanding of participants’ long-term engagement with DBCIs remains sparse. Since the effectiveness of DBCIs to impact behavior change depends, in part, upon participant engagement, there is a need to better understand engagement as a dynamic process in response to an individual’s ever-changing biological, psychological, social, and environmental context.
              Methods
              The year-long micro-randomized trial (MRT) HeartSteps II provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate DBCI engagement among ethnically diverse participants. We combined data streams from wearable sensors (Fitbit Versa, i.e., walking behavior), the HeartSteps II app (i.e. page views), and ecological momentary assessments (EMAs, i.e. perceived intrinsic and extrinsic motivation) to build the idiographic models. A system identification approach and a fluid analogy model were used to conduct autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) analyses that tested hypothesized relationships between these variables inspired by Self-Determination Theory (SDT) with DBCI engagement through time.
              Results
              Data from 11 HeartSteps II participants was used to test aspects of the hypothesized SDT dynamic model. The average age was 46.33 (SD=7.4) years, and the average steps per day at baseline was 5,507 steps (SD=6,239). The hypothesized 5-input SDT-inspired ARX model for app engagement resulted in a 31.75 % weighted RMSEA (31.50 % on validation and 31.91 % on estimation), indicating that the model predicted app page views almost 32 % better relative to the mean of the data. Among Hispanic/Latino participants, the average overall model fit across inventories of the SDT fluid analogy was 34.22 % (SD=10.53) compared to 22.39 % (SD=6.36) among non-Hispanic/Latino Whites, a difference of 11.83 %. Across individuals, the number of daily notification prompts received by the participant was positively associated with increased app page views. The weekend/weekday indicator and perceived daily busyness were also found to be key predictors of the number of daily application page views.
              Conclusions
              This novel approach has significant implications for both personalized and adaptive DBCIs by identifying factors that foster or undermine engagement in an individual’s respective context. Once identified, these factors can be tailored to promote engagement and support sustained behavior change over time.}

  abstract = {This paper presents a Three-Degree-of-Freedom Model Predictive Control (3DoF MPC) framework based on Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) “Model-on-Demand” (MoD) estimation. MoD is a data-centric weighted regression algorithm that generates local models over adaptively varying neighborhoods of changing operating conditions. The 3DoF formulation enables individualized tuning of parameters relating to setpoint tracking and measured and unmeasured disturbance rejection. Online estimation of system dynamics using MIMO MoD and augmentation with the 3DoF MPC structure allows the generation of control laws based on efficient locally linear approximations of system nonlinearities. This paper evaluates the framework through a case study involving a nonlinear MIMO Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) model. The MIMO CSTR system is highly interactive, making data-driven estimation and control notably more challenging than its SISO counterpart. The generation of an informative database using modified “zippered” multisines is presented. The paper concludes with a case study demonstrating the effectiveness of 3DoF MoD MPC in achieving constrained MIMO control of reactor concentration and temperature in the presence of disturbances through a flexible and intuitive approach.}
