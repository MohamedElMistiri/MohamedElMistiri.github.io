title: 'Stochastic Optimization: Renewable Energy Electric Grid Optimization'
description:
  - Developed and evaluated a randomized variant of the Progressive Hedging algorithm to efficiently solve large-scale multistage stochastic programming problems. Demonstrated significant computational speedups with minimal loss in solution quality, using hydroelectric power scheduling as a case study.
