Hi, I'm **Mohamed El Mistiri**, a passionate researcher and engineer driven by curiosity, creativity, and a deep fascination with how intelligent systems interact with the world. I'm currently a **Postdoctoral Research Scholar** at **[Arizona State Universityâ€™s (ASU)](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/)** **[Interactive Robotics Laboratory](https://interactive-robotics.engineering.asu.edu/)**, where I work with **[Prof. Heni Ben Amor](https://henibenamor.weebly.com/about.html)** on the exciting intersection of **machine learning**, **artificial intelligence**, and **control systems engineering** in robotics.

My academic journey began with a **B.S. in Chemical Engineering** from **[ASU](https://semte.engineering.asu.edu/)** in 2017, followed by an **M.S. in 2023** and a **Ph.D. in 2024**, where I specialized in **control systems engineering** under the supervision of **[Prof. Daniel E. Rivera](https://search.asu.edu/profile/29494)**. During my Ph.D., I was part of the **[Control Systems Engineering Lab](https://labs.engineering.asu.edu/csel/)**, where I developed dynamic models and optimization strategies for complex process systems including **chemical processes**, **healthcare technologies**, and **supply chain optimization**  -- skills I now integrate with ML, and AI in **robotic systems** ðŸ˜Ž.

I thrive on building models that make sense of complexity and designing control strategies that make machines smarter, safer, and more adaptable. My research interests include:

- Control theory  
- System identification  
- Machine Learning
- LLMs
- Dynamic modeling  
- Optimization  

Especially as they apply to **process industries**, **robotics**, **healthcare**, and **intelligent systems**.

I'm currently **open to full-time opportunities** where I can bring a control systems engineering mindset, hands-on technical expertise, and a collaborative spirit to innovative teams tackling real-world challenges.

**Letâ€™s connect** â€” whether itâ€™s to explore research ideas, discuss collaboration, or chat about how we can build smarter, more efficient technologies together.
