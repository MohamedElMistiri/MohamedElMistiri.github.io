<!-- Mohamed El Mistiri is Postdoctoral Research Scientist at [ASU's](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/) [Interactive Robotics Laboratory](https://interactive-robotics.engineering.asu.edu/), working with [Prof. Heni Ben Amor](https://henibenamor.weebly.com/about.html) on the integration of ML, AI, Control Systems Engineering in robotics. 
Mohamed El Mistiri received the B.S. degree in chemical engineering from Arizona State University (ASU), Tempe, AZ, USA, in 2017, the M.S. degree in chemical engineering from ASU, Tempe, AZ, USA, in 2023, and the Ph.D. degree in chemical engineering with a focus on control systems from ASU, Tempe, AZ, USA, in 2024. From 2020 to 2024 he was a member of the Control Systems Engineering Lab in ASU, Tempe, AZ, USA. Since January 2025, he has been a Postdoctoral Research Scholar in the Interactive Robotics Laboratory at ASU, Tempe, AZ, USA. His research interests include control theory, system identification, dynamic modeling, and optimization in process systems, robotics, supply chain management, and healthcare. -->


I am **Mohamed El Mistiri**, a researcher and engineer with a deep commitment to advancing intelligent systems through curiosity, creativity, and rigorous problem-solving. I am currently a **Postdoctoral Research Scholar** at **[Arizona State University’s (ASU)](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/)** **[Interactive Robotics Laboratory](https://interactive-robotics.engineering.asu.edu/)**, where I work with **[Prof. Heni Ben Amor](https://henibenamor.weebly.com/about.html)** on the exciting intersection of **machine learning**, **artificial intelligence**, and **control systems engineering** in robotics.

My academic journey began with a **B.S. in Chemical Engineering** from **[ASU](https://semte.engineering.asu.edu/)** in 2017, followed by an **M.S. in 2023** and a **Ph.D. in 2024**, where I specialized in **control systems engineering** under the supervision of **[Prof. Daniel E. Rivera](https://search.asu.edu/profile/29494)**. My dissertation work earned the Dean’s Dissertation Award, recognizing its innovative contributions. During my doctoral work at the **[Control Systems Engineering Lab](https://labs.engineering.asu.edu/csel/)**, I developed **dynamic models** and **optimization strategies** for complex process systems including **chemical processes**, **healthcare technologies**, and **supply chain optimization**. These expertise now inform my work on integrating **control theory**, **machine learning**, and **LLM-based approaches** in **robotic systems**.
